### Welcome!

Fluid mechanics spans diverse fields of science and engineering. I am a fluids enthusiast who aspires to solve real-world geoscience problems with developing and utilizing mathematical and computational modeling.
In my PhD, I investigated multiple fluid flow problems in Earth and planetary sciences. In *hydrology*, I have been involved with **modeling of variably-saturated flow inside heterogeneous soils** at large scales. In *cryosphere*, I am studying **firn densification due to melt percolation** as a part of the *University of Texas Institute for Geophysics Graduate Student fellowship* 
and NASA Jet Propulsion Lab Graduate Fellowship. Furthermore, in *planetary science* am working on **infiltration on early Mars** with the folks from European Space Agency and have been working on the **groundwater on early Mars** with <a href="https://www.ig.utexas.edu/students/eric-hiatt/" target="_blank">Eric Hiatt</a> from Jackson School of Geosciences to investigate the <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/webprogram/Paper712914.html" target="_blank">post-impact hydrothermal systems on early Mars</a>. More recently, I am also studying the **impact generated melt migration** across the ice shell of ocean worlds through second NASA Jet Propulsion Lab Graduate Fellowship. These researches are also supported by my advisor, Dr. Marc Hesse, through NASA Emerging Worlds grant.

### About me

I am a Future Faculty in Pysical Sciences Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University working on large-scale groundwater modeling with <a href="https://maxwell.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Professor Reed Maxwell</a>. I did my M.S. and Ph.D. in Computational Science, Engineering and Mathematics at the University of Texas at Austin with <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/hesse/marc-hesse/" target="_blank">Professor Marc Hesse</a>. I am the Co-chair and DEI lead of the <a href="https://usapecs.wixsite.com/usapecs" target="_blank">US Association of Polar Early Career Scientists</a> and an Executive Board Member of <a href="https://www.agu-h3s.org/people" target="_blank">AGU Hydrology Student Subsection Subcommittee (AGU H3S)</a>.
Before that I was a Visiting Graduate Student Researcher at the MIT Fluids Laboratory working with <a href="https://www.mitfluidslab.com/" target="_blank">Professor Irmgard Bischofberger</a>. 
I hold an M.Phil. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology where I worked with <a href="https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~makxu/" target="_blank">Professor Kun Xu</a> (2018).
