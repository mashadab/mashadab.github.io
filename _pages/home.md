### Welcome!

Fluid mechanics spans diverse fields of science and engineering. I am a fluids enthusiast who aspires to solve real-world problems with developing and utilizing mathematical and computational modeling.
In the past, I have had the pleasure to work in diverse fields of fluid mechanics and numerical methods such as <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/shadab_fifthWENO_CnF_2019.pdf" target="_blank">high order methods</a>, laminar & turbulent combustion, <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/papers/shadab_Scramjet_2017.pdf" target="_blank">hypersonic flows</a>, 
and <a href="https://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/DFD20/Session/S03.3" target="_blank">viscoelastic fluids</a>.
For the last four years, I am investigating multiple fluid flow problems in Earth and plantary sciences. In hydrology, I have been involved with modeling of variably-saturated flow inside heterogeneous soils at large scales. In cryospheric sciences, I am studying **firn densification due to melt percolation** as a part of the *University of Texas Institute for Geophysics Graduate Student fellowship* 
and NASA Jet Propulsion Lab Graduate Fellowship. Furthermore, I am working on infiltration on early Mars with the folks from European Space Agency and have been working on the groundwater on early Mars with <a href="https://www.ig.utexas.edu/students/eric-hiatt/" target="_blank">Eric Hiatt</a> from Jackson School of Geosciences to investigate the <a href="https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm20/webprogram/Paper712914.html" target="_blank">post-impact hydrothermal systems on early Mars</a>. More recently, I am also studying the impact generated melt migration across the ice shell of ocean worlds through second NASA Jet Propulsion Lab Graduate Fellowship. These researches are also supported by my advisor, Dr. Marc Hesse's, NASA Emerging Worlds grant.

### About me

I am an M.S. and Ph.D. Student in the Oden Institute for Computational Engineering and Sciences at the University of Texas at Austin, working with <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/hesse/marc-hesse/" target="_blank">Professor Marc Hesse</a>. I am the Co-chair and DEI lead of the <a href="https://usapecs.wixsite.com/usapecs" target="_blank">US Association of Polar Early Career Scientists</a> and an Executive Board Member of <a href="https://www.agu-h3s.org/people" target="_blank">AGU Hydrology Student Subsection Subcommittee (AGU H3S)</a>.
Previously, I was a Visiting Graduate Student Researcher at the MIT Fluids Laboratory working with <a href="https://www.mitfluidslab.com/" target="_blank">Professor Irmgard Bischofberger</a>. 
I hold an M.Phil. degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology where I worked with <a href="https://www.math.hkust.edu.hk/~makxu/" target="_blank">Professor Kun Xu</a> (2018).
